phys,"Fabrication of Analog Electronics for Serial Readout of Silicon Strip
  Sensors","A set of analog electronics boards for serial readout of silicon strip
sensors was fabricated. A commercially available amplifier is mounted on a
homemade hybrid board in order to receive analog signals from silicon strip
sensors. Also, another homemade circuit board is fabricated in order to
translate amplifier control signals into a suitable format and to provide bias
voltage to the amplifier as well as to the silicon sensors. We discuss
technical details of the fabrication process and performance of the circuit
boards we developed."
phys,Modal Extraction in Spatially Extended Systems,"We describe a practical procedure for extracting the spatial structure and
the growth rates of slow eigenmodes of a spatially extended system, using a
unique experimental capability both to impose and to perturb desired initial
states. The procedure is used to construct experimentally the spectrum of
linear modes near the secondary instability boundary in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection. This technique suggests an approach to experimental
characterization of more complex dynamical states such as periodic orbits or
spatiotemporal chaos."
math,"On second order shape optimization methods for electrical impedance
  tomography","This paper is devoted to the analysis of a second order method for recovering
the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body
$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical
impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has
focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,
no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper
aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative
of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface
$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the
geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives
needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the
stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely
ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer."
math,Iterated integral and the loop product,"In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology and
differential forms based on the theory of Chen's iterated integrals and the
cyclic bar complex."
cs,On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks,"In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden
Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on
two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode
sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$,
without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.
Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for
analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and
for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance
of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both
simulated and real DNA sequences."
cs,Opportunistic Relay Selection with Limited Feedback,"It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on
opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in
dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ
transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the
destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,
suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the
importance of relay selection."
q-bio,"Modeling the effects of HIV-1 virions and proteins on Fas-induced
  apoptosis of infected cells","We report a first in modeling and simulation of the effects of the HIV
proteins on the (caspase dependent) apoptotic pathway in infected cells. This
work is novel and is an extension on the recent reports and clarifications on
the FAS apoptotic pathway from the literature. We have gathered most of the
reaction rates and initial conditions from the literature, the rest of the
constants have been computed by fitting our model to the experimental results
reported. Using the model obtained we have then run the simulations for the
infected memory T cells, called also latent T cells, which, at the moment,
represent the major obstacle to finding a cure for HIV. We can now report that
the infected latent T cells have an estimated lifetime of about 42 hours from
the moment they are re-activated. As far as we know this is the first result of
this type obtained for the infected memory T cells."
q-bio,Stability of the splay state in pulse--coupled networks,"The stability of the dynamical states characterized by a uniform firing rate
({\it splay states}) is analyzed in a network of globally coupled leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. This is done by reducing the set of differential
equations to a map that is investigated in the limit of large network size. We
show that the stability of the splay state depends crucially on the ratio
between the pulse--width and the inter-spike interval. More precisely, the
spectrum of Floquet exponents turns out to consist of three components: (i) one
that coincides with the predictions of the mean-field analysis [Abbott-van
Vreesvijk, 1993]; (ii) a component measuring the instability of
""finite-frequency"" modes; (iii) a number of ""isolated"" eigenvalues that are
connected to the characteristics of the single pulse and may give rise to
strong instabilities (the Floquet exponent being proportional to the network
size). Finally, as a side result, we find that the splay state can be stable
even for inhibitory coupling."
q-fin,"Capital Allocation to Business Units and Sub-Portfolios: the Euler
  Principle","Despite the fact that the Euler allocation principle has been adopted by many
financial institutions for their internal capital allocation process, a
comprehensive description of Euler allocation seems still to be missing. We try
to fill this gap by presenting the theoretical background as well as practical
aspects. In particular, we discuss how Euler risk contributions can be
estimated for some important risk measures. We furthermore investigate the
analysis of CDO tranche expected losses by means of Euler's theorem and suggest
an approach to measure the impact of risk factors on non-linear portfolios."
q-fin,"The public goods game on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks:
  investment strategy according to the pool size","We propose an extended public goods interaction model to study the evolution
of cooperation in heterogeneous population. The investors are arranged on the
well known scale-free type network, the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model. Each
investor is supposed to preferentially distribute capital to pools in its
portfolio based on the knowledge of pool sizes. The extent that investors
prefer larger pools is determined by investment strategy denoted by a tunable
parameter $\alpha$, with larger $\alpha$ corresponding to more preference to
larger pools. As comparison, we also study this interaction model on square
lattice, and find that the heterogeneity contacts favors cooperation.
Additionally, the influence of local topology to the game dynamics under
different $\alpha$ strategies are discussed. It is found that the system with
smaller $\alpha$ strategy can perform comparatively better than the larger
$\alpha$ ones."
stat,"Transient Dynamics of Sparsely Connected Hopfield Neural Networks with
  Arbitrary Degree Distributions","Using probabilistic approach, the transient dynamics of sparsely connected
Hopfield neural networks is studied for arbitrary degree distributions. A
recursive scheme is developed to determine the time evolution of overlap
parameters. As illustrative examples, the explicit calculations of dynamics for
networks with binomial, power-law, and uniform degree distribution are
performed. The results are good agreement with the extensive numerical
simulations. It indicates that with the same average degree, there is a gradual
improvement of network performance with increasing sharpness of its degree
distribution, and the most efficient degree distribution for global storage of
patterns is the delta function."
stat,A Dynamic Algorithm for Blind Separation of Convolutive Sound Mixtures,"We study an efficient dynamic blind source separation algorithm of
convolutive sound mixtures based on updating statistical information in the
frequency domain, andminimizing the support of time domain demixing filters by
a weighted least square method. The permutation and scaling indeterminacies of
separation, and concatenations of signals in adjacent time frames are resolved
with optimization of $l^1 \times l^\infty$ norm on cross-correlation
coefficients at multiple time lags. The algorithm is a direct method without
iterations, and is adaptive to the environment. Computations on recorded and
synthetic mixtures of speech and music signals show excellent performance."
eess,Recognizing Multi-talker Speech with Permutation Invariant Training,"In this paper, we propose a novel technique for direct recognition of
multiple speech streams given the single channel of mixed speech, without first
separating them. Our technique is based on permutation invariant training (PIT)
for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In PIT-ASR, we compute the average
cross entropy (CE) over all frames in the whole utterance for each possible
output-target assignment, pick the one with the minimum CE, and optimize for
that assignment. PIT-ASR forces all the frames of the same speaker to be
aligned with the same output layer. This strategy elegantly solves the label
permutation problem and speaker tracing problem in one shot. Our experiments on
artificially mixed AMI data showed that the proposed approach is very
promising."
eess,"CBinfer: Change-Based Inference for Convolutional Neural Networks on
  Video Data","Extracting per-frame features using convolutional neural networks for
real-time processing of video data is currently mainly performed on powerful
GPU-accelerated workstations and compute clusters. However, there are many
applications such as smart surveillance cameras that require or would benefit
from on-site processing. To this end, we propose and evaluate a novel algorithm
for change-based evaluation of CNNs for video data recorded with a static
camera setting, exploiting the spatio-temporal sparsity of pixel changes. We
achieve an average speed-up of 8.6x over a cuDNN baseline on a realistic
benchmark with a negligible accuracy loss of less than 0.1% and no retraining
of the network. The resulting energy efficiency is 10x higher than that of
per-frame evaluation and reaches an equivalent of 328 GOp/s/W on the Tegra X1
platform."
econ,Frequentist properties of Bayesian inequality tests,"Bayesian and frequentist criteria fundamentally differ, but often posterior
and sampling distributions agree asymptotically (e.g., Gaussian with same
covariance). For the corresponding single-draw experiment, we characterize the
frequentist size of a certain Bayesian hypothesis test of (possibly nonlinear)
inequalities. If the null hypothesis is that the (possibly
infinite-dimensional) parameter lies in a certain half-space, then the Bayesian
test's size is $\alpha$; if the null hypothesis is a subset of a half-space,
then size is above $\alpha$; and in other cases, size may be above, below, or
equal to $\alpha$. Rejection probabilities at certain points in the parameter
space are also characterized. Two examples illustrate our results: translog
cost function curvature and ordinal distribution relationships."
econ,The State of Applied Econometrics - Causality and Policy Evaluation,"In this paper we discuss recent developments in econometrics that we view as
important for empirical researchers working on policy evaluation questions. We
focus on three main areas, where in each case we highlight recommendations for
applied work. First, we discuss new research on identification strategies in
program evaluation, with particular focus on synthetic control methods,
regression discontinuity, external validity, and the causal interpretation of
regression methods. Second, we discuss various forms of supplementary analyses
to make the identification strategies more credible. These include placebo
analyses as well as sensitivity and robustness analyses. Third, we discuss
recent advances in machine learning methods for causal effects. These advances
include methods to adjust for differences between treated and control units in
high-dimensional settings, and methods for identifying and estimating
heterogeneous treatment effects."
